Do not fall for marketing tricks where one price is presented to you and another is established on the spot after the job is done. The price cannot be generalized because it is only realistic and fair to the client that the price of the move be calculated according to the scope of the work that needs to be done. There is no tabular price list and any generalized price according to the square footage of the apartment, the number of tours or workers is completely wrong and leads to additional costs that are revealed to the client on the ground. Clients are thus misled into thinking that they will be charged one price according to the information on the website, and additional costs are added on the ground, such as, for example, you don't have an elevator, you don't have a parking lot, you need to dismantle the wardrobe, etc.","OfferCard2P":"Transport of goods is one of the key factors in modern business, and we at Ultra S Team are here to provide you with a reliable, transparent and customized service.
